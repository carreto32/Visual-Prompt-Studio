I do not have much to say about this first prompt, it was kind of difficult but I will get use to it, just my first time using copilot for these porpuses
somthing i love was how acurred it was from what i wanted and since i am not the best at drawing these was really hepfull 
I hope I can actually connect with the tarms of art and learn how to mix this new future with theory and nit become an ignorant
